/*  On va utiliser le module npm buynan pour historiser les erreurs rencontrées et
gérées par le errorHandler.
Ci dessous la liste des niveaux de log

"fatal" (60):
    The service/app is going to stop or
    become unusable now. An operator should definitely look into this soon.
"error" (50): Fatal for a particular request,
    but the service/app continues servicing other requests.
    An operator should look at this soon(ish).
"warn" (40):
    A note on something that should probably
    be looked at by an operator eventually.
"info" (30):
    Detail on regular operation.
"debug" (20):
    Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
"trace" (10):
    Logging from external libraries used by
    your app or very detailed application logging.
